# ANSI-C Experiments

I'm just doing some experiments in ANSI-C WRT performance optimization topics.

### check_dup

A C-implementation of the task "check whether a character is duplicated within a given string".

The shown implementation should be the best performing one for ANSI-C, but I might actually continue optimizing it if I find a way to optimize it.
